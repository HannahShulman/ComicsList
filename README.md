# ComicsList


Since I had a lot going on on this short period of time (since Thursday) I have the following points stull left opened, 
(and would not deliver code in the current way it is)

Further required:
Pagination. For now limited I query just the first page from backend, have not implemented a mecanism for pagination.
Repository testing. For now I have not yet implemented the repository tests.
Extract Glide functionality to be defined in an interface to enable injection, mocking and testing.
Requires further error handling..

-And as a rule, at every point something can always be improved. Just have to be pragmatic. 
Hope you enjoy, and will obvioulsy appreciate comments, which I guess I'll get during the interview.
Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity.
